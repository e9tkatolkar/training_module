## Assessment


1. Implement a function that takes two file paths as input and copies the contents of the first file to the second file, but in reverse order of lines.
2. Write a function that recursively searches for a specific file name in a given directory and all its subdirectories. Return the full path of the file if found.
3. Implement a function that reads a large text file in chunks and counts the occurrences of a specific word, considering memory efficiency.
4. Write a program that merges multiple JSON files into a single JSON file, handling cases where the files have conflicting keys.
5. Create a function that takes a directory path and returns a JSON representation of the directory structure, including files and subdirectories.
