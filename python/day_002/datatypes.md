## Assignment:
1. Write a function to check if an input is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards, like MALAYALAM). The function should work for any input including strings and numbers.
2. Write a function to insert items into a list at a given index.
3. Give two lists, a and b, write code to show the difference in insert(), append(), and extend().
4. Count the occurrence of each unique element from a list with 72,165 items.
5. Remove duplicate items from a given list of items.
6. Write a function prime_numbers(n) that prints all prime numbers between, and including, 1 and n.
* Example:
  - prime_numbers(31) will return [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]
  - prime_numbers(32) will return [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]
7. Write a Python code snippet to remove the last element from a list.
8. How can you check if a certain element exists in a list?

11. Given a list of integers, write a Python function to remove all occurrences of a specific integer from the list.
12. Given a dictionary of items and their prices, write a Python function to find the most expensive item.
13. Write a Python function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary where the keys and values are swapped.
14. Write a Python function to remove all items with a specific value from a dictionary.
15. Write a Python function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing elements from both tuples.
16. Given a tuple containing the heights of students, write a Python function to find the average height.
