## Git Assessment 2

#### For each of the following tasks, click screenshots and submit those. Each screenshot should be named after the task number

1. Initialize a new Git repository in a directory called "my_project".
2. Create a new file called "README.md" with some content about a fictional project. Stage and commit this file.
3. Create a new branch called "experimental". Create a new branch called "feature-description" and switch to it.
4. Add more details to the README.md file about your fictional project's features. Stage and commit these changes.
5. Create another file called "contributors.md" with your name in it. Stage and commit this file.
6. Switch back to the main branch. Merge the "feature-description" branch into the main branch.
7. Create a .gitignore file and add rules to ignore all .log files and a directory called "node_modules".
8. Switch to "experimental". On this branch, make significant changes to README.md and create a new file called "future_plans.md". Commit these changes.
9. Switch to the main branch and make different changes to the README.md file. Commit these changes.
10. Try to merge the "experimental" branch into main. This should create a merge conflict. Resolve the conflict and complete the merge.
11. Push your local repository, including all branches, to this remote repository.
12. Clone your remote repository to a different directory on your local machine.
13. In the original repository, make some changes, commit them, and push to the remote. Then, in the cloned repository, pull these changes.
14. In the cloned repository, create a new branch, make some changes, and create a pull request to merge these changes into the main branch.
